It is important to note that the technology employed on this website does not detect actual faces of any species. Instead, it identifies patterns in clouds that may resemble facial features. Any resemblance to a living or deceased being is purely coincidental, and the "faces" identified by this technology are not indicative of actual beings in the sky.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 18 px"><u><strong>Accolades:</strong></u> in 2001, Paul Viola and Michael Jones laid important groundwork for the current computer vision technology landscape. Over time, enhancements have been made to the work of feature detection. In addition to Viola & Jones, the creator of this project would like to recognize and thank both David Bradley and Rainer Lienhart for their contributions and allowing open-source access to their XML files for both profile and frontal-face feature detection, respectively. Also, it is important to acknowledge and thank OpenAI for the support and contribution of their powerful language model, GPT-3.5, which played a crucial role in developing the interactive features of this website.</p>
